Week 3 DrumKit Challenge

This should present my version of a drumkit; a site that allows you to play the drums using a set of keys on your keyboard.

I made the background dark and dull to keep the focus on the image and keys themselves and chose a dark setting to make it more comfortable to view. The image used is royalty free from pixabay, which shows a drumset. I added the little avatar with text for humour. The keys are wrapped along the bottom of the site to ensure that all can be viewed and used in any window size. 

I wanted to ensure that all key buttons were easy to read and use, so I went over my html, css and javascript. Despite the program working I am not confident in my coding on these files. I want to look over them and ensure that they meet the intructors requirements as I understand there are numerous ways you can write out code to reach the final goal.
